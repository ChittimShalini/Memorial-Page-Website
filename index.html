	<p>Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, widely regarded as the "Missile Man of India," led an exceptional life filled with achievements, dedication, and contributions 
	to science and technology. Born on October 15, 1931, in Rameswaram, India, he overcame humble beginnings to become one of the most respected figures in Indian history.
    Dr. Kalam's journey is a testament to his unwavering determination and passion for aerospace engineering and science. He graduated in aeronautical engineering from the
	Madras Institute of Technology and joined the Defense Research and Development Organization (DRDO) and the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO).In his illustrious
	career, Dr. Kalam made significant contributions to India's space and missile programs, playing a pivotal role in the development of India's first indigenous satellite 
	launch vehicle (SLV-III) and the successful Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998.His dedication to education and the youth of India was unparalleled. Dr. Kalam authored 
	several inspirational books, including "Wings of Fire" and "Ignited Minds," inspiring countless young minds to pursue science and innovation.Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam
	served as the President of India from 2002 to 2007, during which he continued to inspire and motivate the nation with his vision and wisdom. He received numerous awards
	and honors throughout his life, including the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian award.Kalam was elected as the 11th president of India in 2002 with the support of both
	the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and the then-opposition Indian National Congress. Widely referred to as the "People's President",[6] he returned to his civilian life of 
	education, writing and public service after a single term. He was a recipient of several prestigious awards, including the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour.While
	delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong, Kalam collapsed and died from an apparent cardiac arrest on 27 July 2015, aged 83.[7] Thousands, including
	national-level dignitaries, attended the funeral ceremony held in his hometown of Rameswaram, where he was buried with full state honours.Thousands, including national-level 
	dignitaries, attended the funeral ceremony held in his hometown of Rameswaram, where he was buried with full state honours.</p>
	<h2 class="special">Early life and education</h2>
	<p>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931, to a Tamil Muslim family in the pilgrimage centre of Rameswaram on Pamban Island, then in the Madras 
	Presidency and now in the State of Tamil Nadu. His father Jainulabdeen Marakayar was a boat owner and imam of a local mosque;[9] his mother Ashiamma was a housewife.
	His father owned a ferry that took Hindu pilgrims back and forth between Rameswaram and the now uninhabited Dhanushkodi.Kalam was the youngest of four brothers and one
	sister in his family.His ancestors had been wealthy Marakayar traders and landowners, with numerous properties and large tracts of land. Marakayar are a Muslim
	ethnic group found in coastal Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka who claim descent from Arab traders and local women. The family business had involved trading groceries between the 
	mainland and the island and to and from Sri Lanka, as well as ferrying pilgrims between the mainland and Pamban. With the opening of the Pamban Bridge to the mainland in 1914,
	however, the businesses failed and the family fortune and properties were lost by the 1920s, apart from the ancestral home. The family was poverty-stricken by the time Kalam 
	was born. As a young boy he had to sell newspapers to add to the family's meager income. In his school years, Kalam had average grades but was described as a bright and 
	hardworking student who had a strong desire to learn. He spent hours on his studies, especially Mathematics.After completing his education at the Schwartz Higher 
	Secondary School, Ramanathapuram, Kalam went on to attend Saint Joseph's College, Tiruchirappalli, then affiliated with the University of Madras, from where he graduated in
	physics in 1954. He moved to Madras in 1955 to study aerospace engineering in Madras Institute of Technology.While Kalam was working on a senior class project, the
	Dean was dissatisfied with his lack of progress and threatened to revoke his scholarship unless the project was finished within the next three days. Kalam met the deadline,
	impressing the Dean, who later said to him, "I was putting you under stress and asking you to meet a difficult deadline."He narrowly missed achieving his dream of
	becoming a fighter pilot, as he placed ninth in qualifiers, and only eight positions were available in the IAF.</p>
	<h2 class="special">Career as a scientist</h2>
	<p>After graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology in 1960, Kalam joined the Aeronautical Development Establishment of the Defence Research and Development 
	Organisation (by Press Information Bureau, Government of India) as a scientist after becoming a member of the Defence Research & Development Service (DRDS). He started
	his career by designing a small hovercraft, but remained unconvinced by his choice of a job at DRDO. Kalam joined the INCOSPAR, working under Vikram Sarabhai, the 
	renowned space scientist.He was interviewed and recruited into ISRO by H. G. S. Murthy, the first Director of Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station (TERLS).
    In 1969, Kalam was transferred to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) where he was the project director of India's first Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III)
	which successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in near-earth orbit in July 1980; Kalam had first started work on an expandable rocket project independently at DRDO in 1965.
	In 1969, Kalam received the government's approval and expanded the programme to include more engineers. Kalam addresses engineering students at IIT Guwahati.In 1963 to 1964,
	he visited NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia; Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland; and Wallops Flight Facility.[11][28] Between the 1970s 
	and 1990s, Kalam made an effort to develop the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) and SLV-III projects, both of which proved to be successful.</p>
	<h2 class="special">Presidency</h2>
	<p>Kalam served as the 11th president of India, succeeding K. R. Narayanan. He won the 2002 presidential election with an electoral vote of 922,884, surpassing the 107,
	366 votes won by Lakshmi Sahgal. His term lasted from 25 July 2002, to 25 July 2007.On 10 June 2002, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) which was in power at the time,
	expressed that they would nominate Kalam for the post of President,[40][41] and both the Samajwadi Party and the Nationalist Congress Party backed his candidacy.After the 
	Samajwadi Party announced its support for Kalam, Narayanan chose not to seek a second term in office, leaving the field clear.[44] Kalam said of the announcement of his 
	candidature:I am really overwhelmed. Everywhere both in Internet and in other media, I have been asked for a message. I was thinking what message I can give to the people 
	of the country at this juncture.On 18 June, Kalam filed his nomination papers in the Indian Parliament, accompanied by Vajpayee and his senior Cabinet colleagues.</p>
	<h2 class="special">Death</h2>
	<p>On 27 July 2015, Kalam travelled to Shillong to deliver a lecture on "Creating a Livable Planet Earth" at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong. While climbing a 
	flight of stairs, he experienced some discomfort, but was able to enter the auditorium after a brief rest. At around 6:35 p.m. IST, only five minutes into his lecture, he
	collapsed. He was rushed to the nearby Bethany Hospital in a critical condition; upon arrival, he lacked a pulse or any other signs of life. Despite being placed in the 
	intensive care unit, Kalam was confirmed dead of a sudden cardiac arrest at 7:45 p.m. IST.His last words, to his aide Srijan Pal Singh, were reportedly: "Funny guy! Are
	you doing well?". Following his death, Kalam's body was airlifted in an Indian Air Force helicopter from Shillong to Guwahati, from where it was flown to New Delhi on the 
	morning of 28 July in an air force C-130J Hercules. The flight landed at Palam Air Base that afternoon and was received by the President, the vice-president, the Prime
	Minister, Chief Minister of Delhi Arvind Kejriwal, and the three service chiefs of the Indian Armed Forces, who laid wreaths on Kalam's body.[92] His body was then placed
	on a gun carriage draped with the Indian flag and taken to his Delhi residence at 10 Rajaji Marg; there, the public and numerous dignitaries paid homage, including former
	prime minister Manmohan Singh, Congress President Sonia Gandhi and Vice-president Rahul Gandhi, and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav. On the morning of 29 July, 
	Kalam's body, wrapped in the Indian flag, was taken to Palam Air Base and flown to Madurai in an air force C-130J aircraft, arriving at Madurai Airport that afternoon. His
	body was received at the airport by the three service chiefs and national and state dignitaries, including cabinet ministers Manohar Parrikar, Venkaiah Naidu, Pon 
	Radhakrishnan and the governors of Tamil Nadu and Meghalaya, K Rosaiah and V. Shanmuganathan. After a brief ceremony, Kalam's body was flown by air force helicopter to the 
	town of Mandapam, from where it was taken in an army truck to his hometown of Rameswaram. Upon arriving at Rameswaram, his body was displayed in an open area in front of the
	local bus station to allow the public to pay their final respects until 8 p.m. that evening. On 30 July 2015, the former president was laid to rest at Rameswaram's Pei 
	Karumbu Ground with full state honours. Over 350,000 people attended the last rites, including the Prime Minister, the governor of Tamil Nadu and the chief ministers of
	Karnataka, Kerala and Andhra Pradesh.</p><br>
